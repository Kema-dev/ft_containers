# KEMA'S TODOLIST

## Global

- [ ] Put back "Werror" in Makefile

## Map

- [ ] Lexicographical compare ? Is it a "less" alternative ? Change direct comparisons in methods and use "compare" function (which will itself use less / lexico comp or w/e)
- [ ] Use "Compare(a, b)"
- [ ] Fix value_comp()

## Vector

## Stack

- [ ] Everything (But just use vector as under the hood container = easy)

## Set

- [ ] Everything (But just use map as under the hood container = easy)

## Iterator

- [ ] Implement full iterators (with iterator_traits)
