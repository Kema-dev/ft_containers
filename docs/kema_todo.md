# KEMA'S TODOLIST

## Global

- [ ] Put back "Werror" in Makefile
- [ ] Lexicographical compare ? Is it a "less" alternative ? Change direct comparisons in methods and use "compare" function (which will itself use less / lexico comp or w/e)

## Map

- [ ] if iterator last < first : invert them to prevent from infinite loop
- [ ] insert needs to return a pair value : bool and return existing value if already exists (changes boole truth value)

## Vector

- [ ] if iterator last < first : invert them to prevent from infinite loop
- [ ] Is my EXPANDING_RATIO usage the good one ?

## Stack

- [ ] Everything (But just use vector as under the hood container = easy)

## Iterator

- [ ] Implement full iterators (with iterator_traits)
